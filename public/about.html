                <p>Hi! My name is James Calvano, I am a technologist interested in business and economics. In my free time I enjoy exploring new places, learning about other cultures, continuously learning and getting outside. </p> 
                <p>My interest in technology started from a young age when my family wanted to share one printer. By using the printer manufacturers's website I researched how to attach the family printer to our home network. Excited after completing that project, my interest later evolved into computer networking (routing/firewalls). Later, I was able to apply this interest by being able to network a few Wi-Fi access points spread throughout my family's home to expand coverage for a growing number of devices. A few years later after being given my first computer in the eighth grade I developed an interest in web development. I followed web-dev/graphic design YouTubers that covered concepts from programming to design. </p>
                <p>
                The only thing to match my interest in technology was that of business. My father is a small business owner so daily I was a witness of the benefits as well as the costs of entrepreneurship. In the same vein of business, when I was in middle school I joined the Stock Market Club where my small team was given a simulated $100k to invest. Somehow by typing in random characters (stock tickers) into Yahoo Finance then "buying" share of the companies with the coolest names my team won the game and made a leaderboard in our area's local newspaper. Years later when I was sixteen I convinced my Mom to open a UTMA account with some of my life savings. Also around the age of sixteen I had taken AP Economics; there I learned concepts like supply/demand, market factors (labor/supply) and opportunity cost. Witnessing an entrepreneur deliever value, fasinated by markets and thinking at the time economics could explain everything, I knew I wanted to study business in college. It was not until a few years into my career that I was able to bring both my interests in technology and business together. </p>
                <p>
                I attended the University of Dayton and graduated with a B.S.B.A. in Finance and Economics with an emphasis in Investment Management.

                        <li><b>[2010] How do I build a website? </b></li>
                            <ul><p>In high-school I began seeing large technology companies like Facebook and Google become more and more popular. Online resources like Develophp.com introduced me to HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. I followed videos tutorials line by line and googled concepts that were unknown to me.</p></ul>
                        <li><b>[2016-2017] I spend a lot of time in Excel, can I automate anything? </b></li>
                            <ul><p>My first job out of college was in Corporate Finance. I enjoyed the fast paced, information driven world of informing stakeholders of insights using data. I was responsible for running inventory reconciliation reports, sales/payroll forecasting as well as sales analytics. Trying to differentiate myself as well as reduce the time required to generate some standard reports, I taught myself Excel Visual Basic for Applications (Excel VBA) and Microsoft Access (SQL) which dramatically reduced the number of hours that were needed to deliever insights.</p></ul>
                        <li><b>[2018] Business Intelligence </b></li>
                            <ul><p>After my new skill with spreadsheets had circled the Finance/Accounting department (eventually automated reporting for SVP of Financial Planning) I was selected to liaise larger IT projects between Accounting/Finance and developers. While working with IT I came across the Business Intelligence department, this team at the time was celebrated by the C.E.O. for their quality of work and was relatively small. Fascinated by the scale/breadth of the information they were working with I wanted to learn more.</p></ul>
