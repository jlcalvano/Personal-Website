                <p>Hi! My name is James Calvano, I am a technologist interested in business and economics. In my free time I enjoy exploring new places, learning about other cultures, continuously learning and getting outside. </p> 
                <p>My interest in technology started from a young age, I tried to network printers in my house. Shortly thereafter, my interest later evolved into networking (routing, firewalls), my house was luckily wired with RJ-45 ethernet, and I was frustrated by Wi-Fi dead-spots around my house. Then in high-school I started developing an interest in Web Development (shout out to Adam Khoury @ developphp.com).</p>
                <p>
                My interest in economics and business also started at a young age. My father is a small business owner so daily I was a witness of the benefits as well as the costs of running your own business. In school I joined the Stock Market Club where we were given a simulated $100k to invest and somehow, I made money by typing in random characters (stock tickers) into Yahoo Finance. Fast forward, I took AP Economics in high school; there I learned concepts like supply/demand, market factors (labor/supply) and opportunity cost. Simply said I was hookedâ€¦.</p>
                <p>
                I attended the University of Dayton and graduated with a B.S.B.A. in Finance and Economics with an emphasis in Investment Management. 
                </p>

                        <li><b>[2010] How do I build a website? </b></li>
                            <ul><p>In high-school I began seeing large technology companies like Facebook and Google began becoming more and more popular. Develophp introduced me to HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. I followed line by line how to build a basic social media site (authentication) and a CMS (content management system). Tutvid introduced me to graphic design concepts.</p></ul>
                        <li><b>[2012-2013] I spend alot of time in Excel, can I automate anything? </b></li>
                            <ul><p>During the early phase of my career in Corporate Finance I enjoyed the fast paced, information driven world of informing directors/executives of insights using data. I was responsible for running inventory reconciliation reports as well as sales/payroll forecasting. Trying to make a name for myself as well as reduce the time required to generate the standard reports I taught myself Excel Visual Basic for Applications (Excel VBA) and Microsoft Access (SQL) which dramatically reduced the effort for me and my team to hand in delieverables.</p></ul>

                            <ul><p>After my new skill with spreadsheets had circled the Finance/Accounting department (eventually automated reporting for SVP of Financial Planning) I was selected to liaise larger IT projects between Accounting/Finance and developers.  </p></ul>
