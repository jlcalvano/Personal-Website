                <p>Hi! My name is James Calvano, I am a technologist interested in business and economics. In my free time I enjoy exploring new places, continuously learning and getting outside. </p> 
                <p>My interest in technology started from a young age, I tried to network printers in my house. Shortly thereafter, my interest later evolved into networking (routing, firewalls), my house was luckily wired with RJ-45 ethernet, and I was frustrated by Wi-Fi dead-spots around my house. Then in high-school I started developing an interest in Web Development (shout out to Adam Khoury @ developphp.com).</p>
                <p>
                My interest in economics and business also started at a young age. My father is a small business owner so daily I was a witness of the benefits as well as the costs of running your own business. In school I joined the Stock Market Club where we were given a simulated $100k to invest and somehow, I made money by typing in random characters (stock tickers) into Yahoo Finance. Fast forward, I took AP Economics in high school; there I learned concepts like supply/demand, market factors (labor/supply) and opportunity cost. Simply said I was hookedâ€¦.</p>
                <p>
                I attended the University of Dayton and graduated with a B.S.B.A. in Finance and Economics with an emphasis in Investment Management. 
                </p>
