                <p>Hi! My name is James Calvano, I am a technologist interested in business and economics. In my free
                    time I enjoy exploring new places, learning about other cultures, continuously learning and getting
                    outside. </p>

                    I attended the University of Dayton and graduated with a B.S.B.A. in Finance and Economics with an
                    emphasis in Investment Management.

                            <p>In high-school I began seeing large technology companies like Facebook and Google become
                                more and more popular. Online resources like Develophp.com introduced me to HTML, CSS,
                                PHP, and MySQL. I followed videos tutorials line by line and googled concepts that were
                                unknown to me.</p>
                        </ul>

                            <p>My first job out of college was in Corporate Finance. I enjoyed the fast paced,
                                information driven world of informing stakeholders of insights using data. I was
                                responsible for running inventory reconciliation reports, sales/payroll forecasting as
                                well as sales analytics. Trying to differentiate myself as well as reduce the time
                                required to generate some standard reports, I taught myself Excel Visual Basic for
                                Applications (Excel VBA) and Microsoft Access (SQL) which dramatically reduced the
                                number of hours that were needed to deliever insights.</p>

                            <p>After my new skill with spreadsheets had circled the Finance/Accounting department
                                (eventually automated reporting for SVP of Financial Planning) I was selected to liaise
                                larger IT projects between Accounting/Finance and developers. While working with IT I
                                came across the Business Intelligence department, this team at the time was celebrated
                                by the C.E.O. for their quality of work and was relatively small. Fascinated by the
                                scale/breadth of the information they were working with I wanted to learn more.</p>

                            <p>After discovering a unique skill that I have, I began looking for rolls in technology
                                where I could apply it a majority of the time. I was lucky enough to find a Systems
                                Analyst role at my current company which at the time I was building a team which focused
                                on increasing the efficeny of the finance function. In this new role I have been exposed
                                to new technologies like Python, PowerBi and Tableau.</p>
